# Welcome to my notes

In this repo you will find my personal notes about data structures and algorithms in `JavaScript`, also LeetCode Problems and useful stuff

You will find Some of the most commonly used data structures include:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs (Directed and Undirected)
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap, Priority Queue)
- Hash Tables

In addition to these data structures, it is also important to know various algorithms and their time and space complexities. Some of the most commonly used algorithms include:

1. `Sorting Algorithms` (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.)

1. `Searching Algorithms` (Linear Search, Binary Search, Interpolation  Search, etc.)

1. `Graph Algorithms` (BreadthFS, DepthFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford  Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, etc.)

Mastering some of these data structures and algorithms along with their implementations and complexities should be sufficient for cracking interviews and solving easy to medium level problems on platforms like LeetCode
